I am currently a 3rd year doctoral student in Operations, Informations and Decisions department at the Wharton School. Broadly, I am an applied economist interested in empirical industrial organization and econometrics. In my research, I empirically examine various aspects of digital platforms and marketplaces viz economic, operational and antitrust/legal. In another parallel stream of research, I work on developing new econometric methods, leveraging the recent advancements in empirical industrial organization and machine learning literature.

I did my ScB in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Patna and my SM in Operations Research from Columbia. Due to a hangover from a past life, I also actively publish in top computer science conferences on topics pertinent to AI for social good and multiagent systems. 

Prior to Wharton, I worked as Fixed Income and Futures Trader at Goldman Sachs and Tower Research Capital.
